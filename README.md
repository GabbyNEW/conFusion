# ConFusion

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.3.0.

## Background
This repository is created as part of taking the course **Front-End JavaScript Frameworks: Angular** on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/angular?specialization=full-stack-mobile-app-development). This course concentrates mainly on Javascript based front-end frameworks, and in particular the Angular framework. This course will use Typescript for developing Angular application. Typescript features will be introduced in the context of Angular as part of the exercises. Introduction to the use of Angular Material and Angular Flex-Layout for responsive UI design is also covered. Various aspects of Angular including components, directives and services will be introduced. Data binding, Angular router and its use for developing single-page applications will be learned.  The course also covers designing both template-driven forms and reactive forms. A quick introduction to Observables, reactive programming and RxJS in the context of Angular is included. Then, Angular support for client-server communication through the HTTP client and the use of REST API on the server side will be learned.

On the completion of this repository, the achieved learning goals are the following:
- Be familiar with client-side Javascript frameworks and the Angular framework
- Be able to implement single page applications in Angular
- Be able to use various Angular features including directives, components and services
- Be able to implement a functional front-end web application using Angular
- Be able to use Angular Material and Angular Flex-Layout for designing responsive Angular applications
- Be able to use Observables and RxJS in the context of Angular applications

Within the source files, there are substantial amounts of comments detailing lecture notes and insights learned during the coding exercises. These are written for referencing and reviewing purposes should there be a need to develop an Angular app.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
